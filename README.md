👋 Hello! I'm Sharon Akoth, a passionate Software Developer with over 3 years of experience building robust, maintainable, and scalable applications. My expertise spans frontend and backend technologies, allowing me to contribute to full-stack development and deliver end-to-end solutions that focus on performance, usability, and accessibility.

🔧 Skills & Interests
I work primarily with JavaScript, React, Node.js,ypeScript,C# and Python but I'm always eager to explore new technologies and tools that solve real-world problems. I'm also familiar with RESTful APIs, asynchronous programming, and cloud services like AWS. When it comes to version control and team collaboration, Git is my go-to tool!

🌍 Why I Love Coding
Whether I'm creating a seamless user experience or architecting a backend service, I'm driven by a desire to learn, solve problems, and write clean, efficient code that makes a positive impact. I believe in the power of technology to improve lives and create meaningful connections.

📈 Current Goals
I'm continuously learning and working to deepen my expertise in areas like performance optimization and DevOps practices to ensure applications not only work but scale gracefully.

✨ When I'm not coding, you can find me reading novels, diving into tech blogs, or brainstorming innovative project ideas.
